Feature: Virologus functionality

  Background:
    Given Alice is a Virologus named "Alice"
    And Bob is a Virologus named "Bob"

  Scenario: Successful equipment pickup
    Given there is an Ovohely with a Balta
    And Bob starts on the Ovohely
    When Bob picks up a Vedofelszereles
    Then Bob should have at least one active Vedofelszereles

  Scenario: Failed equipment pickup
    Given there is an empty Ovohely
    And Bob starts on the Ovohely
    When Bob tries to pick up a Vedofelszereles
    Then Bob should not have any active Vedofelszereles

  Scenario: Successful material pickup
    Given there is a Raktar with Aminosav
    And Bob starts at the Raktar
    When Bob picks up Aminosav
    Then Bob should have the specified amount of Aminosav

  Scenario: Failed material pickup
    Given there is a Raktar with insufficient Aminosav
    And Bob starts at the Raktar
    When Bob tries to pick up Aminosav
    Then Bob should not have the specified amount of Aminosav

  Scenario: Successful code scanning
    Given there is a Labor with a GenetikaiKod
    And Bob starts at the Labor
    When Bob scans the code
    Then Bob should have the scanned GenetikaiKod

  Scenario: Successful movement to adjacent field
    Given Bob starts at a TeruletiElem
    And there is another adjacent TeruletiElem
    When Bob moves to the adjacent TeruletiElem
    Then Bob should be on the adjacent TeruletiElem

  Scenario: Failed movement to non-adjacent field
    Given Bob starts at a TeruletiElem
    And there is another non-adjacent TeruletiElem
    When Bob tries to move to the non-adjacent TeruletiElem
    Then Bob should remain on the starting TeruletiElem

  Scenario: Successful creation of Agens
    Given there is a Raktar with enough Aminosav
    And there is a Labor with enough Aminosav for the creation
    And Bob starts at the Raktar
    When Bob picks up Aminosav and moves to the Labor and scans the code and creates an Agens
    Then Bob should have at least one Agens

  Scenario: Failed creation of Agens due to insufficient materials
    Given there is a Raktar with insufficient Aminosav
    And there is a Labor with enough Aminosav for the creation
    And Bob starts at the Raktar
    When Bob picks up Aminosav and moves to the Labor and scans the code and tries to create an Agens
    Then Bob should not have any Agens

  Scenario: Successful planting of Agens
    Given there is a TeruletiElem
    And Bob has an Agens
    And Alice and Bob are on the same TeruletiElem
    When Bob plants the Agens on Alice
    Then Alice should have the planted Agens as a modification
